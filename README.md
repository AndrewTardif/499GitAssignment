# 499GitAssignment
This is the repository for my COSC499 github assignment

I will be making a program in python(3.8) that takes a dataset of numbers and adds them together(sum).

Additional functionality at start will include the ability to choose how to manipulate the data, however it will start with just Summing the numbers together.

Step1: got super frustrated with git in VS with it not working and not going online.... ever.....i hate stackoverflow as well to try and find a solution for this. I just gave up and rewrote my code in notpad, saved it as .py and uploaded it manually here.

Sum functionality summs all data together

Multiply Functionality gets the product

RemoveData functionality removes the last piece of data in the set
